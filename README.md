# Node-IBM-Internationalization
Implementation of internationalization (i18n) library for Node.js. The project is open for contribution. In this prject I have implemented the
IBM internationalization. 

A library for translating apps in Node.js, by externalizing strings into .properties files and resolving to the right translation.

More info is available at https://github.com/IBM/node-i18n-utilities.

Since the time was less therefore couldn't make a proper front end and did all the stuff using back end only.
